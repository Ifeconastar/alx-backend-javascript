# Promises:

#Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous task and allow you to handle the results or errors when they are available.
#Promises have three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected. When a promise is pending, it means the asynchronous operation is still in progress. When it's fulfilled, it means the operation completed successfully, and when it's rejected, it means an error occurred.
#Promises are useful when working with asynchronous tasks such as making API calls, reading files, or executing database queries.
